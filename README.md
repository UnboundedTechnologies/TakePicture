# UNBOUNDED'S TAKEPICTURE

TakePicture is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) website made with [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).
<br /><br />
The purpose of this website is to create a personal gym card using [ngx-webcam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-webcam) which allows to create a profile picture by using a local webcam.
<br /><br />
This website is using a POSTGRE SQL database hosted in [render](https://render.com/).
<br /><br />
The database is linked to a [Strapi.io](https://strapi.io/) backend dashboard that can be accessed through this link:
